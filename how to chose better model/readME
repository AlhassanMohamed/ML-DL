how to chose better model ?
we have all this question !!!
so what you have to do to chose your model.
first you have to train all featuer you have and look to p-value if your column is bigger than 0.05 remove it.
so you will ask me how to chose p-value ?
if you want the answer you have to look at youtube this math and i will not expalin math here.
in my exmaple i delete column by column because the p-value of column is bigger than 0.05
so you have to look to my models and you will understand what i am saying.
best model is model --> 3 
because he have biggest Adi R-square.
